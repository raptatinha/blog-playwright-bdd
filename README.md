On your terminal, run:

To run the Cucumber tests (under /bdd-tests):
1. `npx cucumber-js`

To run the playwright with and without bdd testes (under /tests):
1. `npx playwright test`

The test "Has Title" is intentionally failing so we can see the reports.

The Playwright report will open automatically on failures.

## Important

For this project, coding good practices were not prioritizes since the main goal is to demo the usage of Playwright and BDD. Only the minimun setup was implemented for this demo.
